Custom Neo Vim Configurations

## Requirements

`live_grep` requires `ripgrep` to be installed. `brew install ripgrep`. 
  
## Installation instructions
Clone this repo in `.config/` dir and clone it as `nvim` dir. For the first time you, invoke `:PackerSync` to sync all packages. 

:rocket: That's it. Good to go.
